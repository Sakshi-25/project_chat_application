## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

All this is achieved without having to create a configuration file and writing a long list of rules.
