- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) :
> a JavaScript library for building interactive UI.It is component-based library & allows us to create reusable UI components that manage states & props, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) :
> a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, an open source server environment, designed to build scalable network applications.
> #### Why did we choose NodeJS?

<p>
- Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:
- Sends the task to the computer's file system.
- Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
- Returns the content to the client.
- Ready to handle the next request.
- Here is how Node.js handles a file request:
- Sends the task to the computer's file system.
- Ready to handle the next request.
- When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
- Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
- Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) :
> Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication with reliability and speed. It is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js.
> #### Working of Socket.io
> To establish the connection, and to exchange data between client and server, Socket.IO uses Engine.IO. This is a lower-level implementation used under the hood. Engine.IO is used for the server implementation and Engine.IO-client is used for the client. With sockets, when the server receives a new message it will send it to the client and notify them, bypassing the need to send requests between client and server.

- #### Languages:
  JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
