> **Heroku** 
Heroku is a PaaS platform that offers support for several programming languages. It currently supports Node.js, PHP. Java, Python, Go, Scala, and Clojure. Heroku runs applications in virtual systems that can be customized based on the requirement of clients. The virtual computer systems of Heroku are known as dynos. These can be modified anytime based on the changing needs of users. Heroku users can add more resources through horizontal or vertical scaling.
Heroku charges customers monthly depending on the number of virtual computers they use. This PaaS platform and all applications built on it are all hosted on top of AWS. It makes development more convenient and easier for developers. Users can utilize the platform’s intuitive dashboard to easily perform actions based on requirements.
